## **Planning stage**

### **Target Audiences:**

- Fans of the band, both new and old. Looking for tour dates and information about the band.
- Potential venues and festivals trying to find contact information.

### **User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to see images of the band both onstage and in shoots.
- As a user, I want to see upcoming live shows locations and dates.
- As a user, I want to learn more about the band.
- As a user, I want to navigate my way to all available social media accounts.
- As a user, I want to join a mailing list to be informed when they are coming to location near me or selling merchendise.

### **Site Aims:**

### **How Will This Be Achieved:**

- The site will need to look professional and modern, as the audience is younger it will need to be optimised for mobile.

### **Colour Scheme:**

When deciding the color scheme, I was heavily influenced by the style of released images on their social media and the merchedise that has been released over the last few months. With dark backgrounds and contrasting light text featuring heavily in both, they use color sparingly often with deep reds which can be see in XXXXXX

### **Typography**

Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:

- Lalezar - For the title to give it a strong presence.
- Arimo - For all other headings including the navbar.
- Didact Gothic - for all content text.

I was lucky in the fact that the band already had a font (Neue Haas Grotesk) that they used for posters and social media, I was able to review this and choose a similar font after reading about the inspiration behind the font. Using 'Fontjoy.com' to help build my font pairings I was able to find 3 fonts I was happy to use.

- All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
