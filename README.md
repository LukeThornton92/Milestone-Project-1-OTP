### **Color Scheme:**
When deciding the color scheme, I was heavily influenced by the style of released images on their social media and the merchedise that has been released over the last few months. With dark backgrounds and contrasting light text featuring heavily in both, they use color sparingly often with deep reds which can be see in XXXXXX
