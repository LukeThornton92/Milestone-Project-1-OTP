## **Planning stage**

### **Target Audiences:**

- Fans of the band, both new and old. Looking for tour dates and information about the band.
- Potential venues and festivals trying to find contact information.
- Potential booking agents and music industry contacts.

### **User Stories:**

- As a user, I want to see images of the band both onstage and in shoots.
- As a user, I want to see upcoming live shows locations and dates.
- As a user, I want to learn more about the band.
- As a user, I want to navigate my way to all available social media accounts.
- As a user, I want to join a mailing list to be informed when they are coming to location near me or selling merchandise.

### **Site Aims:**

- To be a professional first impression to the industry.
- To highlight the members of the band and who they are.
- To push people to the bands other social media sites.
- To engage with people via a mailing list, to allow the band to talk to the people who are following them directly.
- To show the impressive photography surrounding the band which tie in with their latest social media campaigns.
- To highlight the individual members of the band.

### **How Will This Be Achieved:**

- The site will need to look professional and modern, as the audience is younger it will need to be optimized for mobile.

### **Wireframes:**

To organize my thoughts and prevent scope creep, I created wireframes for this project. Below are links to each of the mobile and desktop versions of the site.

- Mobile Wireframes:

- Desktop wireframes:

### **Colour Scheme:**

When deciding the color scheme, I was heavily influenced by the style of released images on their social media and the merchedise that has been released over the last few months. With dark backgrounds and contrasting light text featuring heavily in both, they use color sparingly often with deep reds which can be see in XXXXXX

### **Typography**

Throughout the page, there are three fonts used:

- Lalezar - For the title to give it a strong presence.
- Arimo - For all other headings including the navbar.
- Didact Gothic - for all content text.

I was lucky in the fact that the band already had a font (Neue Haas Grotesk) that the band had used for posters and social media, I was able to review this and choose a similar font after reading about the font. Using 'Fontjoy.com' to help build my font pairings I was able to find 3 fonts I was happy to use.

- All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.

## **Features**

Below are some of the features currently within the site.

### **Nav Bar/Menu:**

- The Navbar menu is fully responsive, with links to all the key sections of the page.
- The Navbar is fixed to the top, to ensure a sleek design.
- The Navbar incorporates social media icons

### **Hero Image:**

- The hero image is intended to be a full screen image with, to ensure the first thing visitors see is the members of the band along with the bands name.

- A crucial aspect of the hero image is to display the band, the logo/name and the bands personal styling, which I'm confident

### **About us:**

- General Overview
- Band Members

### **Upcoming Gigs:**

- I wanted to ensure the upcoming gigs was clearly visible and really popped against the rest of the website, so after researching a few different options I decided on using CSS cards.
- With the cards having a contrasting white background to help really highlight the 3 separate events, I opted for a black font.
- I used 2 font styles for the cards, sticking with the "Arimo" for the card headings and "Didact Gothic" for the card text.
- I chose 3 images for the cards to help make them a bigger and more interesting space on the page, I selected images of the band playing live helping to emphasize the "live" element.

### **Gallery**

The gallery was something I was very conscious can make or break a bands website and I wanted it to be a highlight of the website, knowing a lot of traffic would be visiting the site to see photos of the band at shows.

-The design chosen perfectly showcases the images on desktop, I was careful to ensure all the images were of the same size to avoid any stretching or loss of image.

-Due to the design chosen it restricted me when reducing the screen size, screens below 1024px's showcase the images in a standard scroll gallery format.

-With mobile being a

### **Footer:**

- Continuing with the sleek design, I wanted the footer to be almost minimalist, only displaying what was actually needed.
- Using icons from "Font Awesome" and mirroring icons from the Nav-bar.

### **Background**

- My intention with the background was to replicate the heavy grain that is shared across all of the bands social media images, after playing around with some static grain options I wanted to use and animation to bring a constantly changing effect.

## **Future-Enhancements**

- The band has a logo which is used on the drum kit and back drop of their live shows, given more time I would potentially replace the current text logo which a transparent version of this image.

- A large aspect of many band websites allows for the sale of merchandise, I would bring a shopping element into the site as separate page.

- I'm very happy with the gallery on desktop and I would like to bring something more impressive to mobile viewing. Potentially a

## **Testing**

I have included details of testing both during development and post development in a separate document called [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
